## Subject
This is a game about ants in a ant farm who needs to get from start to end as fast as possible. 
Every node can containe only one ant, at each turn you can move each ant only once and through a tube (the room at the receiving end must be empty). At each turn only the ants that moved are dislayed. Efficient solution is the one that takes a least number of turns.
## Usage
    make
    ./lem-in < maps/map
